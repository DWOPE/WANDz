# ðŸ™Œ The Future of WANDz

## Automated Lending (LYX Mode)

After signing a contract in LUKSO's mode and using the Universal Receiver, this will allow the contract from automatically lending/borrowing for the lender indefinitely by itself based on a set of criterias:

* As a Lender: Amount of LYX maximum to be lent and the maximum of concurrent offers per period
* As a Borrower: Choose specific NFTs from your collection to be continuously borrowed until there's no more available offers

This implementation means, both lenders and borrowers wouldn't even have to go in the dapp to use it, it would use itself: auto borrow, auto lend. The receiver will also be used for simply notifying users when their assets are being used anew.

## Rarity Scores on Assets

Affecting APRs calculation: Once a loan offer is made, an APR range is given to the lender, which will dynamically move up or down for the borrower depending on how rare is his NFT asset.

## Advanced Mode

Lenders will be able choose their durations and apy for loan offers in this mode, and by simply toggling on/off a buttons, they'll be able to enter in and out of classic and advanced modes

## SEI v2 Integration

We're going multichain! Our very first expansion will be to the SEI network, specifically on its v2 protocol which supports the EVM architecture. A toggle will be made available to switch chains, iSEI, SEI and USDC (SEI) will be implemented as well.

## $WIZZ Launch

We'll be launching a _**$WIZZ (Wizzdom)**_ our very first ecosystem token, supporting _WANDz_ in it's entirety, on LUKSO and SEI. Here's what you can expect with it:

* Social Score: users are rewarded with points for borrowing a lot, loaning a lot, deduct points for liquidations, revoking and foreclosing.
* It's purpose is a multiplicator of sorts which impacts the platform revenue your _DWOOBz_ will receive each day via airdrop in the form of _**$LYX or $SEI**_ tokens.
* Other criterias will influence your social score and how it's calculated, mainly depending on your participation in the _DWÃ˜PE_ ecosystem.
